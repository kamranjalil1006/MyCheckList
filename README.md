# MyCheckList

Hello Everyone!
My name is Kamran Jalil and I have developed this app for keeping track of our daily-life tasks.
This App was built using the Flutter framework and 'Dart' programming language,and developed inside
our all time Favourite IDE 'Android Studio'.
For State Management, I have used the Flutter's Favourite 'Provider' Package.
I Hope it helps you in managing your daily tasks.

P.S: I personally use it for managing my daily tasks!
